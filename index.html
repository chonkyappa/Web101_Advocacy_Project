    <p>
      In a perfect world, all of the cats and dogs would be living happily with their forever home. In reality, cats, and other animals, live outside where they're subject to dangers and uncertainty of their next meal. For example, feral cat colonies are often seen in urban, suburban, and rural developments like cities and farms. The community may tackle this issue by placing them into shelters, where they are kept until they are ready to be adopted. However, this is not the best solution as shelters have limited space and as a result, may choose to use lethal ways of controlling the population.
      And this is where Operation Catnip comes into play. Instead of shelters, we will be using TNR to control the population. TNR involves trapping the animals, neuturing them, and returning them back to where they were before. In some cases, the animals may be put up for adoption or placed in a foster home. Either way, the animals are being controlled and the community is being revolutionized.

          Too many cats in a shelter presents more issues than it solves. According to the Humane Society, they are more likely to get sick when enclosed with several other cats, in which the shelter may choose to euthanize them.

          As for those ones left outside, they pose a risk to both humans and the environment. Humans may contract diseases and be left to deal with destruction of their property. The environment has also been severely affected by cats as they have been know known to exterminate various species.
